I'm Altynai. Here is some information about me:
1. My favourite quotation is "*Go your own pace - it's getting you to the right place*".
2. I do not like apple butter.
3. I would recommend you to go to Leopoldskron pond in Salzburg. More information about it is here: https://www.salzburg.info/en/travel-info/infos/leopoldskron-pond-leopoldskroner-weiher_az_14958/.
4. I learned a new word in German language, which is "**Bühne**", or a stage. Max Reinhardt told: "The whole town is a stage" about Salzburg. In German this quote is "Die ganze Stadt ist Bühne."
